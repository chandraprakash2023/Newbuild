Project: Build CI/CD Pipeline for Blue/Green Deployment
=======================================================

About
-----
From Udacity:
> In this project you will first create a pipeline that spins up 3 servers and uses Ansible to deploy an application on the servers. Once those servers are running, you will create another pipeline to confirm that servers were configured as expected. Youâ€™ll then uses the "Blue/Green" deployment strategy to deploy additional features to those servers.
